1. What is this?
This is a customized version of the Archive team's ArchiveBot, which I play with,
to make it fit the occlub Archive (Retro Portal) project's needs...

2. Running/Using it

ArchiveBot contains two major components: the control node (aka Backend), which
runs the IRC interface and bookkeeping programs, and the crawlers (aka Pipeline),
which do all the Web crawling. ArchiveBot users communicate with it by issuing 
commands in an IRC channel.

See (INSTALL.backend) to install the control node (Backend). And for installing
the crawler (Pipeline), see (INSTALL.pipeline). Also, don't forget that you can't 
run the backend without having at least one crawler (Pipeline) installed and set 
up to connect to it.

4. Special thanks

Thanks to ArchiveTeam for creating this wonderful thing and to everyone who helped
me (on #archiveteam-bs) understand how it works and resolve the issues I faced.
